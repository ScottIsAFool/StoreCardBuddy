Store Card Buddy
==

# What is it? #
An app that lets you remember your store cards on your Windows Phone so you don't have to carry them round with you. Mileage may vary depending on the store's scanners.

# Instructions #
In order to build this, you will need to create a file called SkyDriveAccess.txt and put that in the StoreCardBuddy.WindowsPhone7 project folder. In that file you should just have your ClientID that was assigned your project from the SkyDrive App management console.
